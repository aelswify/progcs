Intro to Programming with C#
======

The course is based on the curriculum from http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/blog/

Targets audience: 10+

Timeline: 6 classes over the period of 2 weeks (3 classes during the week in the afternoon)

Course outline
-------

 * Introduction to programming - what can be achieved with languages like C# (class 1)
 * Introduction to entities, functions, loops (class 2)
 * Introduction to variables, subroutines, conditional statements (class 3)
 * Mastering loops and subroutines (class 4)
 * Mastering variables and subroutines (class 5)
 * Mastering conditional logic and introduction to system APIs; wrap up (class 6)

Classroom setup
-------

 * 6-30 kids working in pairs
 * Pairs switch on task completion or every 5 minutes
 * Class is taught by a teacher and a number of assistants (1 for every 4-5 pairs)
 * Every pair needs a laptop (provided by parents) with Visual Studio (Express edition is OK) preinstalled
 * All course work is distributed via USB drives provided by the instructor - 1 USB drive per laptop
 * Instructor needs a laptop and a monitor for demonstrations and a whiteboard with markers for highlights

Classroom time (60-90 min)
-------

 1. Setup - 0-15 min
 2. Recipe - 15-20 min
 3. Recap - 5-10 min
 4. Variation - 10-15 min
 5. Quiz - 10-15 min
 6. Enrichment - 20-30 min

Instructor tips and guidelines
-------

 1. Recipe – teachers should have students read the lines of English, teachers should NOT tell the (code) answer, rather teachers SHOULD encourage use of the editor (Intellisense exploration), reading of included documentation and examples.  
 2. Recap – teachers should introduce programming concept words, ex. objects, methods.  teachers should point out ‘help’ from editor, i.e. Intellisense.  Teachers should make mistakes, such as missing arguments and show how to read error messages.
 3. Variation – teachers should ask students to name the properties of the completed recipes shape, i.e. line length, line width, etc…and should write on the white board as a grid (see example for SQUARE recipe below).  Teachers should guide students from simple changes, i.e. change variables from one constant value, such “blue” to “red”, then to complex changes, such as Colors.Red to Colors.GetRandomColor().  Check out this demo of the variation technique – here.
 
 4. Quiz – Teachers should explain the format, i.e. translate one line, then run it to see if you got it right.  Teachers should guide pairs to discovering the answer by having them read the line of English if stuck, use editor to explore and to read the documentation (including the examples).  Teachers should encourage kids to run the quiz after they’ve translated each question.  Teachers should remind pairs if stuck to use ‘UNDO’ to get back to a working state.
 5. Homework – Teachers should run the first couple of homework questions as a group.  Teachers should encourage pairs to change ONLY the ‘___’  Use the same steps as for the Quiz to facilitate leading the kids through the Homework excercises.
 6. Xtras – some recipes have ‘mini-recipes’ included, such as the SPIRAL, which we use when teaching the SQUARE.  These are 5-10 minute, fill-ins.  They give the pairs who finish the guided work (quizzes, homework) before others something else to do.  We usually have the pairs work on these ‘fill-ins’ on their own during guided teaching time.
